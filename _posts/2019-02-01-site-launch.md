I've been wanting to start a site for a while... Since i'm in the midst of searching for job, i thought i could update my CV, and even launch a simple site to document some of the things i've learned and just create a simple portfolio in general.

So here it goes!

brighttux.github.io is launched!
======

I was aware of github pages for a while now, just didn't took the effort to build one. Just few days back, the thought of launching a site popped up again. I took note of the thought, and put some effort into it. 

A quick search on github pages template returned [academicpages.github.io](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). As there was no need of reinventing the wheel in this situation, i took hold of this rather good looking template and added my details into it.

Nothing much to write for now as i'm still setting up this site, however, here's some goals i have for this site.

* Goals:
  * Post up things i learnt using #TodayILearnThat
  * Keep the CV page updated, and use it as my CV from now on, i might have to look into beautifying it soon
  * Make the CV downloadable from the page itself, rather than generating a PDF every time it is updated
  * Some portfolio showcase? 
  * Include publications and Award list
  
Well, for the `TodayILearnThat` section, i guess... it's how to generate a github page? haha. 
Do check back if you'd like to hear more from me.

Not publishing these changes on any of my social medias for now, until this site is ready i suppose.
